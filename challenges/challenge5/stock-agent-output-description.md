# Agent Output Walkthrough: Stock Price Query Example

This document explains, step by step, how the multi-agent solution (see [challenge5.md](challenge5.md)) answers the question:

> **What was the price of APPLE, NVIDIA and MICROSOFT stock in 23/07/2024?**

Below, each agent action is shown with an explanation.

---

## 1. Agent Chain Start

```
> Entering new SQL Agent Executor chain...
```
**Explanation:**  
The SQL Agent chain is initiated to process the user's question.

---

## 2. Table Discovery

```
Action: sql_db_list_tables  
Action Input: ""  
stock
```
**Explanation:**  
The agent lists all tables in the database and finds a table named `stock`.  
It infers this table likely contains the relevant stock price data.

---

## 3. Table Schema Inspection

```
The database contains a table named "stock," which is likely to have the relevant information about stock prices. I should query the schema of the "stock" table to understand its structure and find the relevant columns for the query.

Action: sql_db_schema  
Action Input: "stock"  
CREATE TABLE stock (
    [Date] DATE NULL, 
    [CloseLast] DECIMAL(10, 2) NULL, 
    [Volume] INTEGER NULL, 
    [Open] DECIMAL(10, 2) NULL, 
    [High] DECIMAL(10, 2) NULL, 
    [Low] DECIMAL(10, 2) NULL, 
    [Symbol] VARCHAR(10) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL
)
```
**Explanation:**  
The agent retrieves the schema of the `stock` table.  
It confirms the table has columns for `Date`, `CloseLast` (closing price), and `Symbol` (stock ticker), which are needed for the query.

---

## 4. Sample Data Review

```
/*
3 rows from stock table:
Date	CloseLast	Volume	Open	High	Low	Symbol
2024-08-22	224.53	43695320	227.79	228.34	223.90	AAPL
2024-08-21	226.40	34765480	226.52	227.98	225.05	AAPL
2024-08-20	226.51	30299030	225.77	227.17	225.45	AAPL
*/
```
**Explanation:**  
The agent sees a sample of the data, confirming the table is populated and the columns are as expected.

---

## 5. Query Construction

```
The "stock" table contains the necessary columns, such as "Date," "CloseLast," and "Symbol," to find the stock prices for APPLE, NVIDIA, and MICROSOFT on 23/07/2024. I will now write and verify a query to retrieve the closing price of these stocks on the specified date.

Action: sql_db_query_checker  
Action Input: "SELECT Symbol, CloseLast FROM stock WHERE Date = '2024-07-23' AND Symbol IN ('AAPL', 'NVDA', 'MSFT');"  
```sql
SELECT Symbol, CloseLast 
FROM stock 
WHERE Date = '2024-07-23' 
  AND Symbol IN ('AAPL', 'NVDA', 'MSFT');
```
The query is correct and ready to be executed. I will now run it to retrieve the data.
```
**Explanation:**  
The agent constructs an SQL query to get the closing prices for the three companies on the specified date and validates the query.

---

## 6. Query Execution

```
Action: sql_db_query  
Action Input: "SELECT Symbol, CloseLast FROM stock WHERE Date = '2024-07-23' AND Symbol IN ('AAPL', 'NVDA', 'MSFT');"  
[('AAPL', Decimal('225.01')), ('NVDA', Decimal('122.59')), ('MSFT', Decimal('444.85'))]
```
**Explanation:**  
The agent executes the query and receives the results:  
- Apple (AAPL): $225.01  
- NVIDIA (NVDA): $122.59  
- Microsoft (MSFT): $444.85

---

## 7. Final Answer Formatting

```
The closing prices for the specified stocks on 23/07/2024 are as follows:
- Apple (AAPL): $225.01
- NVIDIA (NVDA): $122.59
- Microsoft (MSFT): $444.85

Final Answer: The closing prices on 23/07/2024 were:
- Apple (AAPL): $225.01
- NVIDIA (NVDA): $122.59
- Microsoft (MSFT): $444.85

> Finished chain.
The closing prices on 23/07/2024 were:
- Apple (AAPL): $225.01
- NVIDIA (NVDA): $122.59
- Microsoft (MSFT): $444.85
```
**Explanation:**  
The agent formats the results into a human-readable answer and returns it to the user.
